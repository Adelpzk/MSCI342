# uwScoop ðŸš—

uwScoop is a new rideshare application exclusive to University of Waterloo Students.
Rather than havingto scroll through rides that dont fit your criteria in a Facebook group, usScoop automatically matches you with rides that fit your criteria.
You meet new people along the way too! uwScoop considers your year, program and music preferences to make your ride most enjoyable
